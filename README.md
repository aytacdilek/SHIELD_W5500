# W5500 ETHERNET SHIELD

I have bought a couple of W550 shields but none of them worked with my NUCLEO board. Eventually, I decided to design my own ethernet shield. Instead of average ethernet shields, i added some sensors, rtc and eeprom ICs on my board. In this way, you can practice web servers with temperature monitor, data logging, real time clock capabilities. 

I used 0805 resistors and capacitors on the board but i see that they take much place. Voltage level conversion was an option but i did not want to waste much time with searching and designing for it. Maybe in next version i will update the board, with 0603 chips and voltage level conversion. For this version it is compatible with 3.3V arduino boards.

Have fun!
